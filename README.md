A workout clock designed for timing circuits and cross-training style workouts. Patterned after the familiar red timers often found on gym walls that cost triple digit dollars.

Supports three modes of operation:

- Stopwatch
- Timer
- Interval rounds (with round counter)

Includes a configurable countdown and optional sounds.
